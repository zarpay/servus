Before starting a session, always review the latest docs in the following order:

1. `/docs/core/**/*.md`
2. `/docs/features/**/*.md`
3. `/docs/guides/**/*.md`
4. `/docs/integration/**/*.md`

Focus on writing code consistent with the rest of the project. Use existing files as references for conventions and style.

Ensure new code always encludes world class YARD documentation. If documentation looks out of date or incomplete, suggest a relevant edit.
